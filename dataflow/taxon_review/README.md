# Taxonomic review of new revisions

From 2020 to 2022 the Taxonomic subcommittee of the New Alaska Flora
Executive Committee reviewed new revisions (since PAF) for Alaska
taxa. The list `accepted_2022-03-16` contains the decisions for
accepted names. The list `all_reviewed_2022-03-16` contains all the
names (accepted an synomyms). This latter list should be included in
the creation of the accepted names.
