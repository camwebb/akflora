# Project information

**“We are building the digital infrastructure and taxonomic basis for the ongoing, community-created, new Flora of Alaska.”**

The **plants of Alaska** are a dynamic mixture of arctic, boreal and
temperate rain forest species, assembled during millenia of migration
between Asia and North America. They are also on **the front lines of
climate change**, experiencing more rapidly changing conditions than
plants elsewhere in the United States, resulting in rapid range shifts
and local extinctions. The last comprehensive Flora of Alaska was
completed fifty years ago, meaning that **vast amounts of digital data
and new taxonomic work remain poorly integrated**; this is a major
barrier to tracking the changing distribution of native Alaskan plants
and new arrivals. **This project will build the digital infrastructure
to integrate names, herbarium specimens, images, citizen science
observations, and taxonomic histories and descriptions**. It will be
innovative in using “taxon concepts” to weave together the data
resources. 

**Taxon concepts** offer a level of information precision beyond that of
scientific plant names alone, but have yet to be used in a
multi-resource database such as this; a sub-goal of the project is to
promote and facilitate the use of taxon concepts more widely. As the
data infrastructure is developed, the database will be populated with
existing digital and scanned-paper information about the plants of
Alaska, and with new data (keys, taxonomic accounts) to be generated
through the collaboration of stakeholders in a new Flora of
Alaska. 

The project will also engage the **wider community of plant enthusiasts**
to expand contemporary species occurrence data by incorporating
iNaturalist observations. Project staff will give training workshops,
and travel to Alaskan villages to work with teachers, thus involving
**Alaskan youth** in the vital process of monitoring shifts in plant
distributions.

**In more detail...**

This project will build an online resource that integrates the most
important information about the vascular plants of Alaska. It will
link the new checklist of Alaskan plant names, a product of years of
research by staff of the Herbarium of the University of Alaska (ALA),
and the Alaska Center for Conservation Science (ACCS), to online flora
resources (the Pan-Arctic Flora and the Flora of North America), and
to information digitized from Hulten's Flora of Alaska, which is the
standard reference work but now nearly fifty years old. This database
will link taxonomic entities to data about the physical specimens in
the herbarium and in other herbaria around the world, and to
geo-referenced observations of plants throughout the state, showing
images of digitized specimens and of plants in the field (via
iNaturalist). The project will also engage in cutting-edge
deconstruction of text descriptions in its constituent floras, parsing
out data on phenotypic characters of each taxon, and presenting these
data in the form of identification resources and contributions to
plant knowledge-bases. 

At the core of this data integration will be informatics
infrastructure based on taxon concepts, which capture not just the
names of plants, but also the historical sense in which those names
were used: the hypotheses of taxonomists. To populate this taxon
concept data layer, we will develop and participate in a workflow for
taxon concept mapping among names used in a core set of Alaskan flora
publications. 

Project staff will actively engage with the community of Alaskan
botanists in the development of a new Flora of Alaska. Data generated
by stakeholders (including taxon reviews and occurrence data) will be
incorporated into the project data platform. Beyond the contribution
of significantly advancing our knowledge of the plants of Alaska, this
project will benefit the university and society by training graduate
and undergraduate students in biodiversity informatics and taxonomy,
and engaging with training of K-12 teachers in rural villages of
Alaska.
