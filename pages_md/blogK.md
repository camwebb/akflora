# Confessions of a taxon concept mapper

One year ago, I was fortunate to have the opportunity for professional
growth in a research area I never thought I would explore -- taxonomy.
More specifically,
[taxonomic concept mapping (TCM)](blog8.html). Before images of dusty,
dark specimen drawers and Victorian-era explorers creep into your
mind, allow me to tell you why I think TCM is extremely important, and
just overall really cool.

1. Taxon concept mapping is an excellent way to introduce
students and early career professionals to the taxonomic literature and
online resources (Biodiversity Heritage Library and International Plant
Names Index, to name a couple). As a non-specialist, my experience with
taxonomy was restricted to learning the basics of the Linnaean
classification system and cladistics. It hadn't occurred to me that
there was an entire history to taxon names beneath the surface, until I
started on the Alaska Flora project. Under the guidance of Cam Webb, I
was reintroduced to the human aspect of the science of taxonomy, and I
imagine it would be reinvigorating even for the established
taxonomist.
2. We need to think carefully about what names mean.  Differences in
taxonomic circumscriptions have implications for how the scientific
community interprets research on certain taxa. Further, when that
research is the basis for policy and conservation initiatives,
confidence in the meaning of a name is paramount.
3. Curating a single, end-all-be-all list for all taxa is
futile. There, I said it. After creating several taxon concept maps
(discussed in [this poster](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4581148)),
I learned it is virtually impossible to keep up with all name changes,
let alone the abstract idea of a taxon that is represented by a name.
All you librarians out there may cringe at this criticism of a
unifying standard (believe me, my inner librarian also has her jaw to
the floor), but if I learned anything from my information science
training, it is that there is _always_ a better way to organize
something in a way that does not reduce the material to something that
is useless to the average researcher. Reduce is the key word here --
by curating a single checklist, we detach the meaning from a name and
each specimen it has been attached to. TCM helps to preserve the
meaning of a name and demonstrate how the meaning has changed through
time. While more work needs to be done to figure out how to scale TCM
and related activities in a way that is globally useful, it is still
possible if enthusiasm for the work remains (I'm looking at you,
students and early career professionals!).

Working on this project has taught me about the power of description and
the beauty of the _meaning_ of a name in different contexts. This
idea extends beyond individuals who consider themselves part of the
scientific community, and into areas of cultural significance and
utility. A name does not exist in a silo, and neither do people.

As I move into the next chapter in my life (fall 2021 PhD program at
the University of Kentucky!), I am eager to unpack the incredible
experience I've had working with the Alaska Flora team. I hope that, by
sharing my adventures in TCM, I've inspired at least one person to look
at names just a little differently.
