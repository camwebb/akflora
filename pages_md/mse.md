# MSE 2021 iNaturalist Exercise

Hi there! [Cam Webb](people.html#cam) here. Thanks for checking this webpage. It was
great fun teaching you (or your kid) on the recent 2021 Aniak Math and
Science Expedition.

As part of learning some botany, we did an exercises at three of the
sites that involved taking photos of plants with the plan to upload
them to an international biodiversity observation project called
[iNaturalist](https://inaturalist.org/). ‘iNat’ has become the main
global tool for capturing amateur and professional observations of
plants and animals. These observations can help scientists understand
how biodiversity is distributed around the globe.  Here in Alaska,
there are now over 90,000
[plant observations](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=6&subview=map&taxon_id=47126)!
However, most of the observations are on the Alaska road and ferry
systems, with very few from smaller communities, and even fewer from
remote areas of the Alaskan bush. We thought that getting kids to take
pictures of plants on the MSE and later upload them to iNat would be a
great way to involve kids in a real science project _and_ to create
valuable data about plant distributions in Alaska: plants in general
are shifting northwards as climate change warms the land, but we do
not yet have enough data to track particular species.

So if you, or your kid, are interested in helping out with this
exciting scientific project, read on...!  (This uploading exercise is
_totally optional_ and not participating will not reflect badly on you
in any way; we understand that finding time and bandwidth can be a
challenge.)

## 1. Get your photos

During our botany classes, I lent the students some digital
cameras. Before they took any plant photos, I asked them to take a
picture of their names in their notebooks, or their faces, so I would
know who the pics belonged to. I’ve now looked at all the pics and put
them into folders, one for each plant taken by a named student at a
known site.  The folders are in a online drive (a Google Drive).

Please note: working on a laptop or desktop computer will be easier
that trying to do this on a tablet or phone.

Please:

 1. Visit the
 [online drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1llZ-Tepzeo2yep4q-ANeTLNUbb5e0f9j),
 find your images, and
 2. Download your photos to your computer’s Desktop.  Put them in a
 folder with the same name as the folder they were in on the Google
 drive.  You can download the whole folder as a ZIP archive by
 hovering your mouse over the folder; a download symbol will appear - just click it.
 3. Remember there may be two or three folders with your name if you
 took pics at several sites, or took pics of several plants at one
 site.

## 2. Create an account on iNat

 1. Go to [iNaturalist.org](https://inaturalist.org/), and click on
   the Sign Up link, then follow directions to create an account.
 2. You can upload a photo of yourself, and customize your profile
   page with some biographical details. iNat is a bit like Facebook, but
   the discussion is just about what you and others find in nature.

## 3. Upload your photos

Please note: there is a very cool iNat app you can add to your phone
or tablet. In the app the photos you take are directly uploaded with
GPS info if you have signal. However, since we were offline and took
photos with a camera, we need to upload images to the website, and add
the longitude and latitude directly.

 1. Click the ‘UPLOAD’ button,
 2. Select all the photos you took of a _single plant_ (i.e., in a
 single folder on you Desktop), and click ‘Done’.
 3. The thumbnails of each photo will appear in the uploading
    page. Hold down the Control key and click on each thumbnail to select all the image of the same plant,
 4. Click ‘Combine’ to group them together,
 5. Click in the ‘Identify’ box. The artificial intelligence in iNat
 will give you a suggestion. You can keep that suggestion, or type the
 name you want to give the plants.  You _do not need_ to identify the
 plant - this is the beauty of iNat: someone else can help you
 identify the images once you have added them.
 6. Date and time. The uploader should be able to read the time-stamp
 that is contained within the images and automatically assign the
 right time and date. If it cannot, or if the date/time is wrong, you
 can edit it manually. See below for the times we were at each
 station.
 7. You must add a location (longitude and latitude) for each plant
 for the observation to be valid. See below for the location of each
 of our stations. To add the location, click in the ‘Location’ box. A
 pop-up will appear with a map. Cut and paste the longitude and the
 latitude from this page into the appropriate box. The marker on the
 map should respond and give you a dot on the Salmon or Aniak rivers.
 8. Finally click ‘Submit 1 observation’ and your images will be uploaded. Be
 patient, it may take a little while since the images we took were
 high resolution.
 9. Repeat steps 1 to 8 for other observations (in a different folder).
 
The iNat help pages are very good. See
[here](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/getting+started#web) for more
directions on uploading your images.
 
## 4. Participate in the iNat community!
 
You can click ‘Explore’ on the top bar of iNat to get to a map of
Alaska and see all the observations that exist. [Zoom in on Aniak](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?nelat=61.84783550301041&nelng=-155.908377477551&place_id=any&subview=map&swlat=60.38886922661095&swlng=-162.873709508801&taxon_id=47126) and you should see some your observation(s) at one of the
stations where we stopped.  If you zoom in, you’ll see other people’s
images too. You can follow those people to see what they upload in
future. You can also comment on their observations and add suggestions
for the plants’ names, or confirm the other persons’ identifications.

Once an identity has been confirmed twice (and there are photos and
location), the observation becomes ‘Research Grade’ and is shared with
global biodiversity databases, such as [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/).
We will also be picking up your observations as part of our Flora of
Alaska project.  

_Welcome to the world of scientific biodiversity
observation!_ And please do get in touch if you have any problems (email:
