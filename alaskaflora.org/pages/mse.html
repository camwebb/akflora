          <p>Hi there! <a href="people.html#cam">Cam Webb</a> here. Thanks for checking this webpage. It was great fun teaching you (or your kid) on the recent 2021 Aniak Math and Science Expedition.</p>
          <p>As part of learning some botany, we did an exercises at three of the sites that involved taking photos of plants with the plan to upload them to an international biodiversity observation project called <a href="https://inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>. ‘iNat’ has become the main global tool for capturing amateur and professional observations of plants and animals. These observations can help scientists understand how biodiversity is distributed around the globe. Here in Alaska, there are now over 90,000 <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=6&amp;subview=map&amp;taxon_id=47126">plant observations</a>! However, most of the observations are on the Alaska road and ferry systems, with very few from smaller communities, and even fewer from remote areas of the Alaskan bush. We thought that getting kids to take pictures of plants on the MSE and later upload them to iNat would be a great way to involve kids in a real science project <em>and</em> to create valuable data about plant distributions in Alaska: plants in general are shifting northwards as climate change warms the land, but we do not yet have enough data to track particular species.</p>
          <p>So if you, or your kid, are interested in helping out with this exciting scientific project, read on…! (This uploading exercise is <em>totally optional</em> and not participating will not reflect badly on you in any way; we understand that finding time and bandwidth can be a challenge.)</p>
          <h2 id="get-your-photos">1. Get your photos</h2>
          <p>During our botany classes, I lent the students some digital cameras. Before they took any plant photos, I asked them to take a picture of their names in their notebooks, or their faces, so I would know who the pics belonged to. I’ve now looked at all the pics and put them into folders, one for each plant taken by a named student at a known site. The folders are in a online drive (a Google Drive).</p>
          <p>Please note: working on a laptop or desktop computer will be easier that trying to do this on a tablet or phone.</p>
          <p>Please:</p>
          <ol type="1">
          <li>Visit the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1llZ-Tepzeo2yep4q-ANeTLNUbb5e0f9j">online drive</a>, find your images, and</li>
          <li>Download your photos to your computer’s Desktop. Put them in a folder with the same name as the folder they were in on the Google drive. You can download the whole folder as a ZIP archive by hovering your mouse over the folder; a download symbol will appear - just click it.</li>
          <li>Remember there may be two or three folders with your name if you took pics at several sites, or took pics of several plants at one site.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2 id="create-an-account-on-inat">2. Create an account on iNat</h2>
          <ol type="1">
          <li>Go to <a href="https://inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist.org</a>, and click on the Sign Up link, then follow directions to create an account.</li>
          <li>You can upload a photo of yourself, and customize your profile page with some biographical details. iNat is a bit like Facebook, but the discussion is just about what you and others find in nature.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2 id="upload-your-photos">3. Upload your photos</h2>
          <p>Please note: there is a very cool iNat app you can add to your phone or tablet. In the app the photos you take are directly uploaded with GPS info if you have signal. However, since we were offline and took photos with a camera, we need to upload images to the website, and add the longitude and latitude directly.</p>
          <ol type="1">
          <li>Click the ‘UPLOAD’ button,</li>
          <li>Select all the photos you took of a <em>single plant</em> (i.e., in a single folder on you Desktop), and click ‘Done’.</li>
          <li>The thumbnails of each photo will appear in the uploading page. Hold down the Control key and click on each thumbnail to select all the image of the same plant,</li>
          <li>Click ‘Combine’ to group them together,</li>
          <li>Click in the ‘Identify’ box. The artificial intelligence in iNat will give you a suggestion. You can keep that suggestion, or type the name you want to give the plants. You <em>do not need</em> to identify the plant - this is the beauty of iNat: someone else can help you identify the images once you have added them.</li>
          <li>Date and time. The uploader should be able to read the time-stamp that is contained within the images and automatically assign the right time and date. If it cannot, or if the date/time is wrong, you can edit it manually. See below for the times we were at each station.</li>
          <li>You must add a location (longitude and latitude) for each plant for the observation to be valid. See below for the location of each of our stations. To add the location, click in the ‘Location’ box. A pop-up will appear with a map. Cut and paste the longitude and the latitude from this page into the appropriate box. The marker on the map should respond and give you a dot on the Salmon or Aniak rivers.</li>
          <li>Finally click ‘Submit 1 observation’ and your images will be uploaded. Be patient, it may take a little while since the images we took were high resolution.</li>
          <li>Repeat steps 1 to 8 for other observations (in a different folder).</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The iNat help pages are very good. See <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/getting+started#web">here</a> for more directions on uploading your images.</p>
          <h2 id="participate-in-the-inat-community">4. Participate in the iNat community!</h2>
          <p>You can click ‘Explore’ on the top bar of iNat to get to a map of Alaska and see all the observations that exist. <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?nelat=61.84783550301041&amp;nelng=-155.908377477551&amp;place_id=any&amp;subview=map&amp;swlat=60.38886922661095&amp;swlng=-162.873709508801&amp;taxon_id=47126">Zoom in on Aniak</a> and you should see some your observation(s) at one of the stations where we stopped. If you zoom in, you’ll see other people’s images too. You can follow those people to see what they upload in future. You can also comment on their observations and add suggestions for the plants’ names, or confirm the other persons’ identifications.</p>
          <p>Once an identity has been confirmed twice (and there are photos and location), the observation becomes ‘Research Grade’ and is shared with global biodiversity databases, such as <a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a>. We will also be picking up your observations as part of our Flora of Alaska project.</p>
          <p><em>Welcome to the world of scientific biodiversity observation!</em> And please do get in touch if you have any problems (email: <code>cowebb@alaska.edu</code>).</p>
